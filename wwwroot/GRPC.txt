1- head of line bloking issue at transport layer 


cons:
1-Timeouts  => pub/sub
2-Error Handling


frontend approaches:
1- gRPC-Web  => JavaScript library  (It works by translating gRPC requests into HTTP/1.1 requests that are compatible with web browsers.)
2- Proxy Server to translate between HTTP and gRPC  =>  Envoy Proxy (can act as sidecar and API gateway) (data plane component in service mesh)
3- gRPC Gateway
4- 



-Service Mesh
VS
-API Gateway


-Service Mesh has two main components:
1- data plane
2- control plane

sidecar
